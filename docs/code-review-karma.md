Code Review Karma (aka. points/leaderboard)
===================

Code Reviews take time and effort to do right; `hubot-code-review` quietly
keeps track of the number of `gives` and `takes` for code reviews across all rooms.

## Configuration

You can disable the code review ranking commands by setting the `HUBOT_CODE_REVIEW_KARMA_DISABLED`
environmental variable to `true`

## What can I say?

	hubot: what are the code review rankings?
	hubot: list all cr scores
	hubot: what is my cr score?
	hubot: what is [USER]'s cr score?
	hubot: remove [USER]'s from cr rankings
	hubot: remove [USER]'s from cr rankings
	hubot: merge [USER1]'s cr score into [USER2]'
